          I felt that my front end skill could use some more polishing, so I decided to try my hand at an Angular page.
          The purpose of this project is to create a simple, attractive web site with some CI/CD features and integrate
          it with my Java services in the cloud.

          The purpose of this project is to setup some simple microservices in AWS with some CI/CD features. I'm pretty
          comfortable with Java development, so this project is simply meant to interact with some AWS services in order
          to integrate things I already know with things I'm trying to learn.

          The purpose of this project is to learn about the features that AWS offers and how that can help me be a more
          productive developer. To improve my skills within the context of enterprise development, my goal is to have
          automated CI/CD pipelines that leverage AWS to deploy my Java applications to the cloud.
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, I am working towards my Solutions Architect certification and trying to work with as many AWS tools
          as I can to get a feel for the ecosystem.
